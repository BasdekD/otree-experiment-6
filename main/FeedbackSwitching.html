    {{ if not player.has_switched }}
        <p>There are two possible reasons for this:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Either because <b> this round is not a moving round.<br/>
                Remember that there is a {{ if session.config.mobility == 'low' }}10% {{ else }} 40% {{ endif }}
                probability that each round is a moving round.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                Or this is a moving round but <b>two other low-income members allocated more Action Points than you</b>
                to their personal account.
            </li>
        </ol>
