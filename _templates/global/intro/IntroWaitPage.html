    <p>Like <b>you, seven other participants</b> exceeded the unknown threshold and produced their income.</p>
    <p>You and these seven other participants will be <b>randomly assigned</b> to either a <b>high-income</b>
        or a <b>low-income</b> group:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Four participants</b> will be randomly assigned to the <b>high-income group</b>
                and their income will be <b>£{{ session.config.high_income }}.</b></li>
            <li>The other <b>four participants</b> will be randomly assigned to the <b>low-income group</b>
                and their income will be <b>£{{ session.config.low_income }}.</b></li>
        </ol>

    <p>
        Now, <b>the computer will randomly assign</b> you and the other seven participants to either the <b>low-income</b> or the
