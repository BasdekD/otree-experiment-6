        Low-income members are given <b>twelve independent chances (twelve rounds)</b> to increase their income.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Each of the twelve rounds is <b>independent from other rounds</b> or in other words <b>what happens in one round does not affect the next round:</b></u>
    <ol>
        <li>If a low-income member <b>moves to the high-income group</b> in a certain round, in the next round he/she
            will again <b>start as a low-income member.</b>
        </li>
        <li>Even when there is <b>income redistribution</b> in one round, in the next round the <b>initial income</b> of the low-income group is <b>£{{ session.config.low_income }}</b> and the initial income of the high-income group is <b>£{{ session.config.high_income }}.</b>
        </li>
    </ol>
        At the end of each round, low-income members will <b>receive feedback about income redistribution</b> and whether they <b>moved to the high-income group in this round.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Each participant will receive as bonus payment the final income of his/her group in one randomly selected round.</b>
