        Some of the twelve rounds are moving rounds. In a moving round, the <b>two, out of the four, low-income
        members</b> who allocated the <b>most Action Points to their personal account</b> will move to the
        high-income group.
    </p>
    <p>According to <b>participants of previous sessions, the probability that each round is a <u>moving round is
        <span class="mobility">{{ if session.config.mobility == 'low' }} 10%{{ else }} 50%{{ endif }}.</span></u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        If the hypothetical round below is a <b>moving round,</b> low-income members <b>A and C</b> will move to the high-income
        group and will <b>receive the final income of the high-income group.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, if this round is <b>not a moving round, all low-income members will remain to the low-income group
        and will receive the final income of this group.</b>
