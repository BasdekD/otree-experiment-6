    <p><b>Low-income members (including you)</b> are endowed with <b>{{ session.config.initial_action_points }} Action Points</b>
        which they can use <b>to increase their income</b> in the following two ways:</p>
    <p>
        <b>First way:</b>
        {{ if session.config.order == 'mobility_first' }}
            Each low-income member can allocate his/her Action Points to a <b>personal account</b> to increase
            his/her chances of <b>moving to the high-income group.</b>
        {{ else }}
            The four low-income members can contribute their Action Points to a <b>public pool</b> to achieve
            <b>redistribution of income from the high-income group to the low-income group
            (i.e., reduce income differences between groups).</b>
        {{ endif }}
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Second way:</b>
        {{ if session.config.order == 'mobility_first' }}
            The four low-income members can contribute their Action Points to a <b>public pool</b> to achieve
            <b>redistribution of income from the high-income group to the low-income group
            (i.e., reduce income differences between groups).</b>
        {{ else }}
            Each low-income member can allocate his/her Action Points to a <b>personal account</b> to increase
            his/her chances of <b>moving to the high-income group.</b>
        {{ endif }}
    </p>
    <p><b>Details about each way of using the Action Points will follow.</b></p>
